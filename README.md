AWS Implementation:

Leverage AWS Cognito for user signup.

Utilize AppSync, API Gateway for seamless communication between frontend and backend services.

AI API Integration:

Integrate the OpenAI API for data processing and intelligent insights. Provide examples of how AI can enhance workout recommendations and meal plans.

Deployment:

Host the repository on GitHub and deploy the web app on AWS Amplify. Clearly document deployment steps, including any specific configurations.

Testing and Security Considerations:

Include a testing section covering unit tests, integration tests, or any testing strategies used during development.

Address security considerations, especially regarding user data and authentication.

Writeup and Presentation:
